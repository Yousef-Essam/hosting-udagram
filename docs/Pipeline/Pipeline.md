# Pipeline Description
- CircleCI was used as the CI/CD software in this application.
- CircleCI is connected to this Github repo, so it watches the repo for changes and when changes are pushed to this repo, CircleCI is triggered to start the pipeline.
- The pipeline is configured by the config.yml file in .circleci folder
- Environment Variables are added to CircleCI which include:
- - AWS credentials which are AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- - AWS related info such as AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
- - Database connection credentials which are the database host, database name, username and password.
- - The elastic beanstalk app and environment which serves the backend
- - The unique name of the S3 bucket which holds the frontend files
- - Secrets such as the JWT_SECRET
- The pipeline uses a Docker container to create a virtual environment in which CI/CD operations are done.
- The pipeline starts by installing Node.js and its related technologies such as npm and yarn.
- The pipeline then installs aws-cli for the operations related to deploying to S3 bucket
- The pipeline installs eb-cli for deploying the backend
- Checkout is used to fetch the contents of the github repo in the environment
- The environment variable are set along with AWS credentials
- The dependencies of the frontend and backend are installed
- Build folders are generated for the frontend and backend
- Linting and Testing "Templates" are prepared
- Deployment of the frontend to the S3 bucket is done.
- Deployment of the backend API to the elastic beanstalk instance is done.
- With this, the pipeline is successfully executed and the application gets fully deployed with automated pipelines.
